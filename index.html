                        I took my baby on a Saturday bang<br>
                        Boy is that girl with you<br>
                        Yes we're one and the same<br>
                        <br>
                        Now I believe in miracles<br>
                        And a miracle has happened tonight<br>
                        <br>
                        But, if you're thinkin' about my baby<br>
                        It don't matter if you're black or white<br>
                        <br>
                        They print my message in the Saturday Sun<br>
                        I had to tell them I ain't second to none<br>
                        <br>
                        And I told about equality and it's true<br>
                        Either you're wrong or you're right<br>
                        <br>
                        But, if you're thinkin' about my baby<br>
                        It don't matter if you're black or white<br>
                        <br>
                        I am tired of this devil<br>
                        I am tired of this stuff<br>
                        I am tired of this business<br>
                        Sew when the going gets rough<br>
                        I ain't scared of your brother<br>
                        I ain't scared of no sheets<br>
                        I ain't scared of nobody<br>
                        Girl, when the goin' gets mean<br>
                        <br>
                        Protection<br>
                        For gangs, clubs, and nations<br>
                        Causing grief in human relations<br>
                        It's a turf war on a global scale<br>
                        I'd rather hear both sides of the tale<br>
                        See, it's not about races<br>
                        Just places<br>
                        Faces<br>
                        Where your blood comes from<br>
                        Is were your space is<br>
                        I've seen the bright get duller<br>
                        I'm not going to spend my life being a color<br>
                        <br>
